In this experiment, you will listen to short clips of sentences being spoken at the same time.

At the end of each clip, you will be asked a question about what you heard.

There will be a training section before you begin the experiment.

When the experiment begins, you can take as long as you like to answer the questions at the end of trials.

If you need to rest or pause the experiment, you may do so at the end of any trial you want.

When you've read these instructions, press '5' to move on to the training instructions.
#
In each trial (about 8 seconds) there are three adult German speakers: one male, two female.

After listening to the entire trial, you will be asked whether you heard a different "pitch segment".

The different pitch segment will be very short: the speech will briefly change pitch then go back to the same pitch.

Press '5' to continue.
#
The pitch might become lower (sounds deeper) or higher (sounds more child-like).

Different pitch segments will be part of the sentences being spoken.

There may or may not actually be a different pitch segment.

The different pitch segment can be among the sentences of any speaker, and it can be at any direction (left/right/center).

Press '5' to continue.
#
You have completed the training section.

The experiment will follow the same procedure as training, but you will not be informed of whether your answers are correct.

Let the experimenter know now if you have any questions or concerns, or did not understand any part of the task.

Press '5' to start the first experiment trial.
#will be very similar with only a small difference:

From now on, you should pay attention to whatever is being spoken at the RIGHT SIDE.

As you have already realized, the speaker towards the right will keep changing. 

As a speaker moves to the left, try to not follow them, but instead focus your attention to the new speaker to the right.

Press '5' to continue.
#
To help you get acquianted with this new task, there will be a couple of practice trials before the experiment resumes.

Listen and practice keeping your attention at the speech you hear in your right ear.

Press '5' to hear a practice trial.
#
From now on, keep your attention on the RIGHT side ONLY.

If it helps, you can focus on what is being said in the right and try to make sense of it, so that you keep your attention locked to the right.

You will still be asked whether you heard a different pitch segment at the end of each trial. 

Press '5' to continue.
#
Important note: You should report Yes if you happened to hear a different pitch segment that didn't come from the right 

- but it's very important that you try as hard as you can to only focus on the right side and ignore the left side.

Let the experimenter know if you are having trouble keeping your attention towards the right.

Press '5' to start the first trial of the next section.
#will be very similar with only a small difference:

From now on, you should only pay attention to the MALE speaker and follow whatever he is saying.

The male speaker will always start from the left ear. You can start following him there.

Press '5' to continue.
#
To help you get acquianted with this new task, there will be a couple of practice trials before the experiment resumes.

Just listen and practice following the male speaker.

Press '5' to hear a practice trial.
#
From now on, keep your attention on the MALE speaker ONLY.

You can focus on what the male is saying and try to make sense of it, so that you keep your attention locked on him.

You will still be asked whether you heard a different pitch segment at the end of each trial. 


Press '5' to continue
#
Important note: You should report Yes if you happened to hear a different pitch segment that wasn't male 

- but it's very important that you try as hard as you can to only focus on the male and ignore the females.


Let the experimenter know if you are having trouble keeping your attention on the male voice.

Press '5' to start the first trial of the next section.
#
You have completed the experiment!


Thank you and have a good day ☺!
#
At the start of the training, the different pitch segments will also be louder.

This is to help you actually hear what you are supposed to be looking out for.

Try to understand what different pitches sound like, and press '3' to repeat what you heard as many times as you need.

When you repeat a trial, it will show you exactly where the different sound was.


Press '5' to hear the first training trial.
#
Now the different pitch segments will no longer be louder.

They will be at the same loudness you will hear during the experiment itself.

The experiment trials will be exactly the same as the ones you will practice with now.


Again, try to find the different pitch segments.

Remember, it can be higher or lower (noticeably more so than natural speech differences), by any speaker and at any direction. 

Higher sounds like a child, and lower sounds like a deeper voice.
